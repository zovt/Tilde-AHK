Tilde
=====

A customizable tiling window manager written in AutoHotkey for Windows

Configuration
=====
A basic config file example is shown as Default.ini. It includes values for a dual-monitor set up with both monitors running at 1080p. You may modify this file to suit your needs, and then rename it to Config.ini for the script to load it. If you want the script to attempt to automatically detect your setup, rename the file FirstRun.ini to Config.ini and run Tilde.
